Kpopifying Code is a creative coding project that aims to create a musical composition, remixing the popular pop song Espresso by Sabrina Carpenter, into a kpop song. The remix will mainly take inspiration from a kpop girl group called ILLIT who releases cute, fun and dream-like songs.

## Overview

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.13
- TunePad
- TunePad Documentation

## Features
Each musical component (instrument) is created in what TunePad defines as a 'cell'. Within these cells you are able to select the instrument, write code to make the instrument play, and individually play that instrument. All these cells when played together creates the song. 

TunePad also has 'code cells' which allows you to write large blocks of code to then later import into your instrument cells.
