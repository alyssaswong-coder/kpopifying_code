## Overview
Kpopifying Code has been created using the free browser based software called TunePad. Through basic musical knowledge and a learnt understanding on python, this project was acheived in the span of approximately 6-7 weeks. Through thorough research on both Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso and ILLIT's discography, this project attempts to create a cute, dream-like song to disect and listen to.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.13
- TunePad

## Features
Each musical component (instrument) is created in what TunePad defines as a 'cell'. Within these cells you are able to select the instrument, write code to make the instrument play, and individually play that instrument. All these cells when played together creates the song. 

TunePad also has 'code cells' which allows you to write large blocks of code to then later import into your instrument cells.

TunePad allows for custom audio recordings to be uploaded into your project library through the 'TunePad Sound Recorder' feature, therefore allowing you to expand the sounds you are able to create. For this project one custom sound was used.
